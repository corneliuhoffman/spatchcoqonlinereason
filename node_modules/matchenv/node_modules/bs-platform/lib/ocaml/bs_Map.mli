    How we remain soundness:
    The only way to create a value of type [_ t] from scratch 
    is through [empty] which requires [_ Bs_Cmp.t]
    The only way to create [_ Bs_Cmp.t] is using [Bs_Cmp.Make] which
    will create a fresh type [id] per module

    Generic operations over tree without [cmp] is still exported 
    (for efficient reaosns) so that [data] does not need be boxed and unboxed.

    The soundness is guarantted in two aspects:
    When create a value of [_ t] it needs both [_ Bs_Cmp.t] and [_ t0].
    [_ Bs_Cmp.t] is an abstract type. Note [add0] requires [_ Bs_Cmp.cmp] which 
    is also an abtract type which can only come from [_ Bs_Cmp.t]

    When destructing a value of [_ t], the ['id] parameter is threaded.
