# Contributing

Thanks for your help! Due to BuckleScript's nature, the contribution setup isn't all straightforward (though well documentated). If something isn't working, please file an issue or ping us in [Discord](discord.gg/reasonml)!

## Setup

Prerequisites:

- [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/), the OCaml package manager
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
- Make
- OS: Mac/Linux (BuckleScript works on Windows, but developing the repo in Windows isn't tested. Contribution welcome!)

```
# Use the correct opam switch for working on BuckleScript
opam update
opam switch 4.02.3+buckle-master
opam switch reinstall 4.02.3+buckle-master # do this if you get errors even from a clean compilation
opam install camlp4 cppo
eval `opam config env`

# Install dev-time npm dependencies
npm install

# Build BuckleScript's forked OCaml
cd vendor/ocaml
./configure -prefix `pwd`
make world.opt
make install

# Build BuckleScript itself
cd ../../
make
make install

# install this local bs globally
npm -g install .
```

## Test on a Dummy Project

Go somewhere else and do this:

```
bsb -init foo -theme basic-reason
cd foo
npm run build
```

And whenever you modify a file in bucklescript, run this inside `jscomp/`:

```
make ../lib/bsc.exe && ./install-bsc.sh
make ../lib/bsb.exe && ./install-bsb.sh
```

This will substitute the global `bsc.exe` & `bsb.exe` you just installed with the newly built one. Then run `npm build again` in the dummy project and see the changes! The iteration cycle for testing these should be around 2 seconds =).

## Troubleshooting

Did any of the above step not work?

- If you get compilation errors even from a supposedly clean compilation, you might have skipped the opam reinstall step above: `opam switch reinstall 4.02.3+buckle-master`

- Make sure you did "eval `opam config env`" In your CLI/bashrc/zshrc

- **If the vendored ocaml changed between when you last iterated on the repo and now**, you probably skipped the `opam switch reinstall 4.02.3+buckle-master` part. You'll have to do `git clean -xdf` and then restart with the build instructions. Careful, as `git clean` removes your uncommitted changes.

- **If these fail too**, make sure you do have the correct `ocamlopt` in your environment: `which ocamlopt` should show an `opam` path, not `reason-cli` path. If you see the latter, this means it overrode the global `ocamlopt` BuckleScript needed. In this case, either temporarily uninstall reason-cli or make sure your opam PATH overrides the reason-cli PATH (and not the other way around) in your bashrc/zshrc.

## Special Iteration Workflow

This section is reserved for when you're making a change to the vendored ocaml compiler itself, in vendor/ocaml, and then testing on super-errors changes at the same time. If you're doing this for whatever reason, then the previous quick iteration workflow wouldn't work. Here's what you have to do after each change:

```
# at project root
cd jscomp
make force-snapshotml # make sure your changes are reflected in jscomp/bin/whole_compiler.ml
make -C ../lib bsc.exe && ./install-bsc.sh
make -C ../lib bsb.exe && ./install-bsb.sh
```

## Contributing to the runtime

BuckleScript runtime implementation is currently a mix of OCaml and JavaScript. (`jscomp/runtime` directory). The JavaScript code is defined in the `.ml` file using the `bs.raw` syntax extension.

The goal is to implement the runtime **purely in OCaml** and you can help!

Each new PR should include appropriate testing.

Currently all tests are in `jscomp/test` directory and you should either add/modify a test file which covers the part of the compiler you modified.

- Add the filename in `jscomp/test/test.mllib`
- Add a test suite. The specification is in `jscomp/test/mt.ml`. For example some simple tests would be like:
  ```ocaml
  let suites : _ Mt.pair_suites =
     ["hey", (fun _ -> Eq(true, 3 > 2));
         "hi", (fun _ -> Neq(2,3));
         "hello", (fun _ -> Approx(3.0, 3.0));
         "throw", (fun _ -> ThrowAny(fun _ -> raise 3))
         ]
  let () = Mt.from_pair_suites __FILE__ suites
  ```

- Run the tests:
  `mocha -R list jscomp/test/your_test_file.js`
  To build libs, tests and run all tests:
  `make libs && make -C test all && npm test`

- See the coverage: `npm run cover`

## Contributing to the API Reference

The API reference is generated from doc comments in the source code.
[Here](https://github.com/bucklescript/bucklescript/blob/99650/jscomp/others/js_re.mli#L146-L161)'s a good example

Some tips and guidelines:

- The first sentence or line should be a very short summary. This is used in indexes and by tools like merlin.

- Ideally, every function should have **at least one** `@example`.

- Cross-reference another definition with `{! identifier}`. But use them sparingly, they’re a bit verbose (currently, at least).

- Wrap non-cross-referenced identifiers and other code in `[ ... ]`.

- Escape `{`, `}`, `[`, `]` and `@` using `\`.

- It’s possible to use `{%html ...}` to generate custom html, but use this very, very sparingly.

- A number of "documentation tags" are provided that would be nice to use, but unfortunately they’re often not supported for \`external\`s. Which is of course most of the API.

- `@param` usually doesn’t work. Use `{b <param>} ...` instead

- `@returns` usually doesn’t work. Use `{b returns} ...` instead.

- Always use `@deprecated` when applicable.

- Always use `@raise` when applicable.

- Always provide a `@see` tag pointing to MDN for more information when available.

See [Ocamldoc documentation](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/ocamldoc.html#sec333) for more details.

To generate the html, run `make docs` in `jscomp/`.

Html generation uses a custom generator located in `odoc_gen/` and
custom styles located in `docs/api_static`.

## Contribution Licensing

Since BuckleScript is distributed under the terms of the [LGPL Version 3](LICENSE), contributions that you make

we will need explicit confirmation from you that you are able and willing to provide them under

other major open source projects.

To participate under these terms, all that you must do is include a line like the following as the
last line of the commit message for each commit in your contribution:

    Signed-Off-By: Random J. Developer <random@developer.example.org>

You must use your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms, and no anonymous contributions).
